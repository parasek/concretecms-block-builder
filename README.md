# Block Builder

Block Builder is a Concrete5 addon that lets you easily create your own custom blocks (with one optional set of repeatable entries).

# Requirements

Min. Concrete5 version: 5.8.2.1

PHP 5.5.9+ (PHP 5.6 or 7 recommended)

If you want to use block builder for version 5.7 check [Block Builder Legacy](https://github.com/parasek/c5-block-builder-legacy).
It has almost the same functionality but uses pre-8.0 code/api.

# Features

This addon is made for developers. It allows you to quickly create skeleton for your block, but you still need to manually add some custom css/html code in view.php.
